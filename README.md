# Pyrin node helper files by Kryptex
Easy setup and basic usage

## How to set up a node and wallet
1. Place these files into pyipad folder
2. Run `1-Setup.cmd` and setup your wallet. 
3. Follow the easy step-by-step process

You need to select seed phrase and wallet and press enter to copy them.

## Operations
**You need a node and wallet to be running and syncronized to view balances and spend Pyrin.**
1. Run  `2-Node_And_Wallet.cmd` - two cmd windows will appear - for wallet and for node. 
2. Wait until full sync (node window will show "block accepted" messages) 

### After this you may use other .cmd files
- Balance.cmd - shows current balance
- Send.cmd - send Pyrin to another address.


## If something goes wrong
If you want to run setup again you may delete `Pyipad` and `Pyrinwallet` folders in AppData\Local (%localappdata%).
Do not do that if you already used your wallet or you will lose funds on it.
